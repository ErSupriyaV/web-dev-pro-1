<h1><b>RAMESHWARAM<a name="top"></a></b></h1>
<img style="width: 594px; height: 397px;" src="ram.jpg" alt="ram">
<p><big>Rameshwaram is an island situated in the gulf of
manner at the very tip of the Indian peninsula. A very important
pilgrim centre of the Indians. Rameshwaram is the place from where Lord
Rama, built a bridge across the sea to rescue his consort Sita, from
her abductor, Ravana. This is also the place where Rama worshipped Lord
Shiva to cleanse away the sin of killing Ravana. Both the Vaishnavites
and Shaivites visit this pilgrimage which is known as the Varanasi the
south.</big></p>
<p><big>Visiting Rameshwaram is significant for the Hindus
as a pilgrimage to Benaras is incomplete without a Pilgrimage to
Rameshwaram. The presiding deity is the Linga Of Sri Ranganatha, which
happens to be one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of India. Rameshwaram is
also popularly referred to as the 'Benaras of the south'. In order to
attain Moksha it is believed that the visit to Rameshwaram is mandatory.</big></p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Winding roads, a cool breeze at all
times, vantage points offering
breathtaking views of hills and valleys, plenty of strawberries to
gorge on and a main street full of shops offering all kinds of curios
and snacks. Doesn&#8217;t it sound exciting? Well, that&#8217;s Mahabaleshwar for
you which along with Panchgani makes for a wonderful holiday or even
just a weekend getawayLocated about 120 kilometers southwest of Pune
and 285 kilometers from Mumbai, Mahabaleshwar is a vast plateau
measuring 150 kilometers, bound by valleys on all sides. It reaches a
height of 1,439 meters at its highest peak above sea level, known as
Wilson or Sunrise Point. Mahabaleshwar comprises three villages:
Malcolm Peth, Old &#8216;Kshetra&#8217; Mahabaleshwar and part of a village called
Shindola. <br>

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;The hill station is the source of the Krishna
River that flows across
Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The legendary source of the
river is a spout from the mouth of a statue of a cow in the ancient
temple of Mahadev in Old Mahabaleshwar.According to a legend, Krishna
is Lord Vishnu himself as a result of a curse on the trimurtiby
Savitri. Also, its tributaries Venna and Koyana are said to be Lord
Shiva and Lord Brahma themselves. An interesting thing to notice is
that four other rivers come out from the cow&#8217;s mouth apart from Krishna
and they all travel some distance before merging into Krishna. These
are the Koyna, Venna, Savitri and Gayatri.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Points To Visit
Kate&#8217;s Point gives visitors a view of the Dhom and
Balakwadi dams. Close to it is the Needle Hole point where there is a
natural hole in between its rock formation. Wilson Point, which is the
highest point of the hill station, gets its name from Sir Leslie Wilson
and is a favourite with tourists for splendid views of sunrise and
sunset. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; The second-highest peak in Mahabaleshwar is Connaught Peak
and
gets its name from the Duke of Connaught

Point, Carnac Point, Falkland Point, Helen&#8217;s Point, Elphinstone Point,
Mumbai Point, Marjorie Point and Babbington Point. For boating you must
head to the Venna Lake. During the monsoon, waterfalls such as Lingmala
Falls and Dhobi Falls come alive, adding to the scenic splendour of the

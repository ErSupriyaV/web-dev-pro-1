<p><big>The Golden Temple Amritsar India (Sri Harimandir
Sahib Amritsar) is not
only a central religious place of the Sikhs, but also a symbol of human
brotherhood and equality. Everybody, irrespective of cast, creed or
race can seek spiritual solace and religious fulfilment without any
hindrance. It also represents the distinct identity, glory and heritage
of the Sikhs. To pen-down the philosophy, ideology, the inner and outer
beauty, as well as the historical legacy of Sri Harimandir Sahib is a
momentous task. It is a matter of experience rather than a of
description.</big></p><p id="demo" style="display:none">
<big>As advised by Sri Guru Amar Dass Ji (3rd Sikh
Guru), Sri Guru Ram Dass Ji (4th Sikh Guru) started the digging of
Amrit Sarovar (Holy Tank) of Sri Harmandir Sahib in 1577 A.D., which
was later on brick-lined by Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji (5th Sikh Guru) on
December 15, 1588 and He also started the construction of Sri
Harimandir Sahib. Sri Guru Granth Sahib (scripture of the Sikhs), after
its compilation, was first installed at Sri Harimandir Sahib on August

<h2>history of golden temple amritsar</h2>
<img src="gtemp5.jpg" alt="ram">
<p><big>Sri Harmandir Sahib, also known as Sri Darbar Sahib
or Golden Temple, (on account of its scenic beauty and golden coating
for English speaking world), is named after Hari (God) the temple of
God. The Sikhs all over the world, daily wish to pay visit to Sri
Amritsar and to pay obeisance at Sri Harmandir Sahib in their Ardas.</big></p>
<p><big>
Guru Arjan Sahib, the Fifth Nanak, conceived the idea of creating a
central place of worship for the Sikhs and he himself designed the
architecture of Sri Harmandir Sahib. Earlier the planning to excavate
the holy tank (Amritsar or Amrit Sarovar) was chalked out by Guru
Amardas Sahib, the Third Nanak, but it was executed by Guru Ramdas
Sahib under the supervision of Baba Budha ji. The land for the site was
acquired by the earlier Guru Sahibs on payment or free of cost from the
Zamindars (landlords) of native villages. The plan to establish a town
settlement was also made. Therefore, the construction work on the
Sarovar (the tank) and the town started simultaneously in 1570. The
work on both projects completed in 1577 A.D.</big></p>

<p><big>Located in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the
hamlet of Shani Shingnapur is famous for the temple dedicated to Hindu
god Saturn. A quaint custom of not locking doors of their houses
followed by the locals; has also made it a popular tourist destination.
The villagers believe that the temple is a &#8216;jagrit devasthan&#8217; which
means the temple is alive and god safeguards the temple and the nearby
region. It is believed that god punishes anybody who attempts to steal.
So potent is the fear of God Saturn that despite the absence of doors,
there are no reports of thefts in the village.</big></p>

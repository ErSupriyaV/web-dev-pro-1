&nbsp; &nbsp; The hill stations are
high-altitude towns used, especially by European colonialists, as a
place of refuge from the summer heat. They are prevalent in Southeast
Asia and the Indian Subcontinent, particularly India.
The Indian subcontinent has seven principal mountain ranges and the
largest of all is the Himalayas that lies in the northern part of
India. The famous peaks and ranges include the Kangchenjunga range in
the Eastern Himalayas which frames the hill stations of Darjeeling and
Gangtok as well as the Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand. Then there is
Shivalik range that also lies within the same region has some famous
hill stations that include Dalhousie, Kullu, Shimla, Nanital and many
more.</big></p>

Most of the hill stations in India were developed by the British,
around a central mall, to get respite from the oppressive summer
heat. Many have picturesque lakes as their focal point, making
them
excellent places for boating activities.
Most of the hill stations in India are located in Jammu and Kashmir,
Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh,
Nagaland and Meghalaya in the Himalayas and in Maharashtra, Karnataka,
Tamil Nadu and Kerala in Western ghats. Some of the hill stations in
India are listed below by state.
Since all these hill stations are world-famous they are frequently
visited by tourists on a summer vacation tour. Due to this almost all
of the above hill stations are well connected by rail, road and air
services to major Indian cities.</big></p><href onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='block'"><big><big><b>Read more</b></big></big></button>

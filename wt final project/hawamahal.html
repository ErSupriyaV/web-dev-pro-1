The renowned 'Palace Of The Winds', or Hawa Mahal, is one of the
prominent tourist attractions in Jaipur city. Located in the heart of
Jaipur, this beautiful five-storey palace was constructed in 1799 by
Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh who belonged
to Kachhwaha Rajput dynasty.
The main architect of this palace built of red and pink sandstone, is
Lal Chand Ustad and the palace is believed to have been constructed in
the form of the crown of Krishna, the Hindu god.
<p id="demo" style="display: none;"> Considered as
anembodiment of Rajputana architecture, the main highlight of Hawa
Mahal
is its pyramid shape and its 953 windows or 'Jharokhas' which are
decorated with intricate designs. The main intention behind the
construction of the Mahal was to facilitate the royal women and provide
them a view of everyday life through the windows, as they never
appeared in public.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p><big>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was in 1799 that the Kachhwaha
Rajput ruler,
Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh who built
Jaipur, constructed Hawa Mahal as a continuation of the
Royal City Palace.&nbsp; Sawai Pratap Singh's devotion to Lord
Krishna
is evident in the palace's construction as it resembles the lord's
crown. Though many reasons are cited behind the construction of the
fort, Purdah system followed by the Rajputs is said to be one of the
main causes. During those days, Rajput royal women did not appear in
public or in front of strangers.</big> </p>

<p><big>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, they were keen to follow the
day-to-day
events and royal processions occurring on the streets. It is for their
benefit that the Hawa Mahal was built, complete with small windows and
screened balconies. This gave the women a sense of freedom, without
appearing in public.</big></p>
<br>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p><big>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hawa Mahal, designed as a beehive castle with
small
windows, has a height of 50 feet from its base. This structure, erected
on a thin shield or podium approximately fifty feet high, has walls
less than a foot thick. Constructed of red and pink sandstones by Lal
Chand Ustad, Hawa Mahal is famous for its windows or 'Jharokhas' which
enable free circulation of air within the structure.</big> </p>

<p><big>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its entrance is a door which leads to a spacious
courtyard
surrounded by two-storey buildings on three sides. Of the five storeys
of the Mahal, the top three storeys have the thickness of a single room
while the bottom storeys have courtyards. The interior of the Hawa
Mahal is stark and plain with passages and pillars reaching to the top
storey. The building does not have stairs to reach the upper floors;
the storeys are connected by slopes. From Hawa Mahal, you have an
excellent view of the city. The monument also has an archeological
museum.</big></p>

The Jantar Mantar, in Jaipur, is an astronomical
observation site built in the early 18th century. It includes a set of
some 20 main fixed instruments. They are monumental examples in masonry
of known instruments but which in many cases have specific
characteristics of their own. Designed for the observation of
astronomical positions with the naked eye, they embody several
architectural and instrumental innovations.
This is the most significant, most comprehensive, and the best
preserved of India's
historic observatories. It is an expression of the astronomical skills
and cosmological concepts of the court of a scholarly prince at the end
of the Mughal period.</big><br>

<h2>History</h2>
<br>
<big>The Taj Mahal is described as a &#8220;teardrop on the face of
eternity&#8221; by legendary poet Rabindranath Tagore. The Taj Mahal is
considered by many, to possess architectural beauty unsurpassed by any
other structure in the world.</big>
<p id="demo" style="display:none"><big>
Constructed over a period of 22 years, employing twenty thousand
workers, it was completed in 1648 C.E. and costed a whopping 32 million
Rupees. Built entirely of white marble, it almost seems to glow in the
moonlight, with the shimmering Jamuna river situated just across. The
Muslim emperor Shah Jahan built this monument in the memory of his wife
Mumtaz, whose grave is housed within the premises at the lower chamber.
The grave of Shah Jahan was added to it later.</big></p>

<br>
<big>The Taj stands tall and regal on a raised, square platform,
forming an unequal octagon with its four truncated corners. The
architecture uses the interlocking arabesque concept, where each
element is singular in its entirety, but integrates seamlessly with the
whole. The central dome spans 58 feet in diameter and soars to a height
of 213 feet. It is flanked on four sides by smaller domed chambers,</big>
<p id="demo" style="display:none"><big> and
four slender minarets rising to a lower height of 162.5 feet. The
entire mausoleum is decorated with an inlaid design of flowers and
calligraphy using precious gems like agate and jasper, and the main
archways are carved with passages from the Holy Qur&#8217;an.</big>
